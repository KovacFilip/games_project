# About

I created this project to get hands on tailwind-css and typescript.

I also used axios and react-router

# To run on your pc

You need to create an .env file, where you create a variable `REACT_APP_API_KEY` with a value you get from https://rawg.io/apidocs
Then you can just run it like a normal react app - npm run in a terminal
